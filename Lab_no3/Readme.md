# DSD Lab Assigment 3

## Main Module (RTL)
Created a full adder module using combinational logic and implementing new learnt operators such as; AND gate `&` , OR gate `|`, NOT gate(Inverter) `~`, XOR gate `^`.

## Testbench
Implemented `Self-Testing` Test bench and `Direct Testing`, Self-Testing will be useful in the future where you have to work with very large numbers and large number of test cases.
