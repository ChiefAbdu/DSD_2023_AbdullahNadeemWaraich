# DSD Lab Assigment # 2

## Main Module (RTL)

Implemented a code (logic) using `local signals`, understanding them and displaying an `output` on the leds corresponding to the the `inputs` and the combinational logic.

## Constraint File (XDC)

Constraint File is used to define components and how to correspond to each signal that you defined, Signals defined by input and output can be added in a constraint file only (Local Signals can not be assigned to any component).
